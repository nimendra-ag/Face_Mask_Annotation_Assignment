# Facemask Detection Dataset Augmentation

This project focuses on enhancing the training dataset for facemask detection models by collecting, curating, and augmenting images with and without facemasks. The dataset was annotated using **Roboflow** and exported in **YOLOv9** format. Various augmentation techniques were applied using **Albumentations**, including **resize, vertical flip, horizontal flip, random rotation, cropping, padding, and D4 transformations**, ensuring bounding boxes remain accurate. The dataset is now ready for training a facemask detection model.
